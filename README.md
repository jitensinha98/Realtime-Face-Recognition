# Realtime Face Recognition using python and opencv
This project is based on the detection and recognition of trained faces of individual beings.I have haar cascading model present in opencv to detect faces in images and video feeds and for recognition , i have used LBPH model in opencv because unlike other methods , it is not sensitive to light.

## Modules Used
- OpenCv
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- random
- os

## Steps to use
- Delete the ***README.md*** present in ***Dataset*** directory and create individual directories with each person's name and inside that them store the same person's images . Use atleast 23 images.
- Run ***face_recognition.py*** to train the model and for relatime execution.
```
python3 face_recognition.py
```
- Press ***'a'*** to stop the program.
